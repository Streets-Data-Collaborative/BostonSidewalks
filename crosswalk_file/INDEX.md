The stress index for Boston's sidewalks is merged with the various administrative units they fall under:
* ZIP Codes
* PWD Districts
* Boston Police Department Districts
* Boston Fire Department Districts
* Election Wards/Precincts
* BTD - Boston Transportation Department Districts
* BPDA - Boston Planning and Development Authority Districts
* Official city neighborhoods
* State/County/Tract/Block Group FIPS code for Census

These data can be joined to polygon shapefiles for all these spatial classification units, to develop insights at that particular level of administrative unit.
